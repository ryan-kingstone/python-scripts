[![No Maintenance Intended](http://unmaintained.tech/badge.svg)](http://unmaintained.tech/)

A repository of scripts used for personal purposes.

Current scripts in the repo:
```
    mp3ren.py
        Usage: arg0 folder with files
        Purpose: rename mp3 files
```
```
    pastebin-parse.py
        Usage: run py script
        Purpose: scrape pastebin and download public pastes.
```
```
    jsdeob.py

        Purpose: iterate and replace obfuscated js script (rainingchan/server/min.js)
```

>Please notice for file handling:
>Instead of handling files within the python-scripts folder, all scripts are set up to use
>the directory above the script directory. This prevents cluttering of the repository.
